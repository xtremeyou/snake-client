# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here. https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer


## Getting Started

- Clone the server above into a folder, then cd into it.
- Next you'll run npm install while in that folder
- while still in the terminal inside the server file you've just cloned, run "npm run play" without the quotes*
- Now in a new terminal (leave the first still running), git clone my files into another folder
- navigate to that folder which contains my files
- Run npm install in that folder
- Once that's done, run node play.js in another terminal
- You should now be able to move the snek around using w for up, s for down, a for left, and d for right!
- Enjoy!



...If any errors happen close the terminals with ctrl c and rerun the snek multiplayer server, then my play.js again (both in different terminals). Goodluck and have fun!
